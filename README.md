This is a version of my [personal blog](https://github.com/YonicDev/yonic-corner-astro) designed specifically for late 1990s browsers. It is made with the same framework as the modern blog: Astro.

## Minimal browsers

While Astro outputs HTML5 compliant pages, this blog only elements from up to HTML 4.01, and uses CSS2 alongside with jQuery 1.0 for cross-browser JavaScript. These are the browsers that have been tested to work with all these features:

* **Windows 9x/NT**: Internet Explorer 5.5, Firefox 2, K-Meleon 1.5.4, Opera 9
  * Internet Explorer 5 also works with the blog, but jQuery features will not.
* **Mac OS Classic 9**: Netscape 7, Classilla 9.3.4 Beta
