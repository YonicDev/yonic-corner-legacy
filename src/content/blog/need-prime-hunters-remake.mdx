Ever since the [announcement of *Metroid Prime 4*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFbDmTjS_MI) way back in 2017, and especially after it was announced that the [development of the game would be reset and get back to Retro Studios's hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLIv_UXI_So), I have speculated about whether a remake of *Metroid Prime: Hunters* would be made as a teaser of what is to come. This blog post will cover my reasons as for why we need one, and why I initially thought there was one on its way.

## *Hunters* aged really badly

The *Metroid Prime* series has defined a new standard when it came to first person action-adventure games. Some games tried to follow the steps of this, but there hasn't been any notorious examples of this so far.

This is also true for *Hunters*. The game was released under a fairly troubled and confusing development cycle, and very early in the Nintendo DS era.

Aesthetically speaking, *Hunters* is very subpar with the rest of the series, considering the original *Metroid Prime* was a title developed around at an **earlier** relative timeframe as *Hunters* (approximately one year after the GameCube was released) and yet the first *Prime* is deemed one of the most good-looking games on the platforn, while the former is not.

However, it's not just the graphical and visual style that don't feel inferior. The audio shows heavy signs of compression, as well. While this was common in games of the earlier Nintendo DS games, *Hunters* is one of the notable cases where this is prominent.

Of course, the **Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection** functionalities from the DS and Wii era that this game took a heavy bet on was eventually discontinued, so by purchasing this game now, you're missing out on pretty much half of the experience.

## It might have been a good introduction for new players

Now, this reason has been completely crushed by the release of *Metroid Prime Remastered*, but at the time, I did consider *Hunters* could have served as a decent way to introduce players to the *Metroid Prime* series.

However, it might need several changes when it comes to area layouts and story. Many areas and gameplay mechanics were originally designed thinking about the multiplayer mode first, so much so that **the game was delayed in order to properly had support for Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection** and online matchmaking.

The story mode of *Hunters* was mostly built as a **side story** for the *Prime* series without much cohesion to the rest of the timeline. At first. *Metroid Prime 3: Corruption* only extended upon this side story with the cameo of Sylux.

This brings me to the next point...

## The Sylux in the room

Sylux is a bounty hunter who has been marketed as a character shrouded in mystery when it was introduced in &mdash;you guessed it&mdash;*Metroid Prime: Hunters*. Aside from booklet and information from the official site

Ever since then, Sylux has made cameo appearences in the following *Prime* titles: *Corruption* and *Federation Force*. In these games, he appears as if he were to be plotting something. While his appeareance in *FF* is more significant to the plot, his appeareance at the end of *Corruption* is perplexing.

One would assume that Sylux would be relegated to a recurring antagonist within the spin-offs of the *Prime* series, but this is clearly not the case. **Kensuke Tanabe confirmed he does indeed appear** in *Corruption*.

If he was going to be relegated to spin-offs, why making an appeareance in a mainline game? Considering how deeply interconnected and carefully designed the *Metroid* lore is, this doesn't seem like just a treat for the fans.

Also, all the mainline *Prime* games had the radioactive substance called **Phazon** as their centerpiece. However, it is heavily implied that the storyline involving Phazon is over after *Corruption* concludes. It seems like **Prime 4 could be a turning point for Sylux's character arc**. Whether this is fleshed out from the spin-off games a la *Kingdom Hearts* style, or he is properly reintroduced as a central character to the story is not clear to me.

But if his character extends from the lore of *Hunters*, this could pose a problem.

## Lack of availability

*Metroid Prime: Hunters* is arguably one of the hardest games of the series to play legitimately. With the discountinuation of the Nintendo eShop for Wii U and 3DS, **the only legitimate way to play this game is by getting an original physical copy of the game.** So far, no DS games have appeared on the Nintendo Switch Online service, so there's little hope for this game to show up there for now.

The other games where Sylux has appeared are also unavailable digitally, so you have to buy a physical copy. *Federation Force* is especially notable because not many have bought the game, so getting a copy at a reasonable price might be tricky.

So if *Prime 4* is going to feature Sylux, it might not be a good idea to present him with the expectations that players will want to play the other harder to get games to understand his character a bit better.

With this in mind, my ideal storytelling approach would be:

1. ***Metroid Prime Remastered*** as an introduction for newer players to the *Prime* series.
2. ***Metroid Prime: Hunters* remake** as a proper introduction for Sylux (and maybe the other hunters)
3. ***Metroid Prime 4*** for delving deep into the Sylux arc.

At first, I didn't had much hope for a remake of *Hunters* after **Prime Remastered** was shadow dropped, but with the recent history of Nintendo releasing remakes and remasters of previous games, I believe now that this has started to become an ever likelier scenario. We'll see with time if I'm right or not.
