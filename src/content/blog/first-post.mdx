<div class="feed-preview">
The Yonic Corner is back! And this time, it's back with a new
design, structure, and content. However, it still remains (mostly)
true to its original version.
</div>

## What has changed?

Nothing much, really. **The core structure is very similar to**
the old blog, but it has departed from the generic PaperMod design.

This new design I like to call **Vectarcade**, is heavily inspired
on how the web used to look like in the late 90s to early 2000s,
an era where CSS started to gain foothold and pixel graphics were
the main trend.

Although for this design, I did not restrain myself from using modern CSS, 
I'm working on a way to expand the compatibility to older browsers
(Internet Explorer may be out of the question, however...), and instead of
pixel graphics, I'm using low resolution vectorized versions with a similar style.

One of the biggest changes apart from the design is the switch from **Hugo** to **Astro**.
The main reason for the change was because I've been having a much more positive
developer experience in Astro than Hugo, and also so I can do a little bit of CSR,
which is somewhat tough to do in Hugo.

At the end of the day, this should give you a very similar experience to the older version
of the blog. And the philosophy of the blog remains the same:
Striving to reduce as much bloat as possible. Astro helps a lot by
striping away most of the JavaScript that other frameworks would throw in.
So you can still browse this blog with **Noscript** or any other
solution available to have JavaScript disabled, without any hiccups.

<noscript>
I mean, if you're seeing this paragraph is because you have JavaScript disabled.
And you're still able to explore this blog perfectly. Hooray!
</noscript>

On that matter, I found a way to get rid of the YouTube player. Instead, now it's
using an alternative that also works without JavaScript! No more ads, no more bloat!

## There's still work to do

There are still a couple things that are missing from the former version:

- The **music player** is not ready yet. I promise, I'll make it work without JavaScript, like before.
But I don't discard the possibility of making a JavaScript one version to go along with the other.
- I'm still debating on whether I'll add a **dark theme** or not.
But if I decide on making one, I'd like to have a working **responsive** design first.
- I'd like to reintroduce **RSS feeds** sometime.
- **Multiple languages** like Spanish and Japanese aren't top in my priority list, but
there's a chance I'll add them back sometime.

There are also some new features I'd like to add to the site, 
as well as a few things I need to polish like SEO and some accessibility features.

    And don't forget, I'm still here! The character system is still not
    fleshed out, but it works at the very least!
