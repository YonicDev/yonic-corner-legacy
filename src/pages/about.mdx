description: Learn about me and my personal blog.

I am a Spanish game developer, and I welcome you to my (not so) personal space.

Of course, I love videogames, but I also have a thing for cartoons, science stuff and astronomy, 
as well as a huge curiosity for Japan and its culture.

## About this blog

I plan to write about wild thoughts in my head, my experiences, and
programming and UX/game design tips. Maybe it'll be a bit hard to find your
way through the site, so I made multiple ways of surfing my site:

* **Categories:** Pretty much what it says on the tin. Every article belongs to just one.
* **Tags:** Very useful for specific searches. Most articles have more than one tag.
* **Series:** Think of it as a blog version of a music or video playlist:
An ordered list of articles talking about the same topic, split into
multiple parts.

The design of the **Legacy Version** is similar to that from the modern version of my blog,
but stays more true to the late 1990s design, which I like to call Pixarcade.
Instead of vectorized artwork, you'll see lots of pixel animated GIFs and all other
kinds of dithered artwork. Many influences include several websites from the
late 1990s - early 2000s, as well as Rhyhtm Heaven. Although I think this design
looks a bit too much like a Microsoft page from the Windows XP era.

This version of the blog trades off all modern web technologies for compatibility
with browsers from the late 1990s. Instead, it relies on jQuery to handle
more dynamic content. However, **the vast majority of browsers will do just fine
with JavaScript disabled.** Feel free to navigate the blog without bloat!

## About this blog's characters

A common signature feature of many old-school blogs, especially Japanese ones,
is to have some characters wandering about the site, giving the place a lot of personality.

In here, these characters take form of sprites that can show multiple expressions and emotions.

By the way, if you put your cursor over the characters on your PC,
you can see what they're thinking about!

**Yonic** is the main character of this site, and one of my oldest characters I've ever came up with.
He has had many redesigns over the years, but at its core, he hasn't changed much,
which goes to show how fond I am of this character.

<TextBubble position="bottom" alignment="far" theme="yonic">
    Maybe it's a nostalgia thing, but I think I like this design of the Legacy blog more than the modern one.
</TextBubble>
<Chara name="yonic" set="summer" sprite="thinking" thoughts="Yonic is happy to see you!" />

Right now you'll only see Yonic wandering about, but very likely you'll see more in the future.
