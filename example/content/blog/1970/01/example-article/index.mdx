Since 1.2.0, Anything within the `<div class="feed-preview">` element will be displayed in the partial feed. **It also includes all the innerHTML, so be careful.** In 1.3.0, a full feed will also be generated with all content from the post.

Components that use the `<FeedBranch>` component will split rendering between the full HTML content and the streamlined content for RSS feeds.
</div>

## Player link

Music metadata is stored in `content/music`, and the `id` property points to the JSON metadata file relative to that folder. Only music entries with an HTTP (*not* HTTPS) source will be considered. If a music entry does not have any, it will be marked as "Not available".

<PlayerLink id="sample/music" />

You can have several types of source:
* **Direct source *(direct link)***, specified with the MIME type.
* **YouTube sourced**, specified with a YouTube video id and the type `'youtube'`. These are ignored in the Legacy version.
* **Internet Archive sourced**, specified with the object and item IDS of an Internet Archive item.

Note that music playback requires Flash Player 6 or higher. Flash Player 7 is not recommended due to being prone to crashing the browser.

## Images (figures)

The `<Figure>` component is a powerful one for displaying responsive images with thumbnails at whatever format you wish. It has the same properties as the Astro builtin `<Picture>` component. You can set the `fallback` format for browsers that do not support HTML5 `<picture>` elements.

Images can be imported from a path relative to the MDX file. Making a folder inside `blog/year/month` and then put `index.mdx` is the standard structure, with assets being included inside this folder, and not inside the `assets` folder.

The Legacy version will render a normal image with a single source with the `fallback` format, which may be a non-partially transparent PNG, JPG, or GIF.

<Figure src={Airplane} alt="The first GIF in existence" width="200" formats={['webp','gif']} fallback="gif">
    <>Captions are shown here. We're using a JSX fragment to avoid unnecessary HTML.</>
</Figure>

If you do not set a `width`, it will automatically span to the width of the post, which is also the maximum width it can have.

<Figure src={Lena} alt="Standardized picture of a woman">
    <>That's a **big** woman!</>
</Figure>

...That was a weird caption. For images with no captions, just don't write anything inside the figure element.

<Figure src={ColorChecker} width="200" alt="Several test color swatches" />

The source image has to be a PNG, JPG, or GIF, WEBP or AVIF in format, but the destination format must be PNG, JPG or GIF, and is specified in the `fallback` prop (defaults to JPG). SVG images are also supported, but you must supply a raster figure exclusively for the Legacy Version.

Images with partial transparency are not supported in the Legacy version. Instead, use GIF images.

<VersionBranch>
    <Figure src={YSvg} alt="Logo of YonicStudios" width="100" slot="modern">
        <>This is a vector SVG image.</>
    </Figure>
    <Figure src={YSRaster} alt="Logo of YonicStudios" width="100" slot="legacy" fallback="gif">
        <>This is a rasterized GIF image from a SVG one.</>
    </Figure>
</VersionBranch>

## Text bubble and Character sprites

This section changes a lot depending the version of the blog, so we're using `<VersionBranch>` to split showing the relevant content for each version.

<VersionBranch>
<TextBubble position="bottom" alignment="far" theme="yonic" slot="modern" name="Yonic">
    Text bubbles in the modern version have the following properties:
    * **`position`**: Indicates which side of the text bubble should the speech triangle be positioned.
    * **`alignment`**: Sets where in that side the triangle should be positioned.
        * `near` is up in vertical and left in horizontal sides.
        * `far` is down in vertical and right in horizontal sides.
        * `center` is in the middle of any side.
    * **`theme`**: The visual theme of the TextBubble. It usually matches the name of the character who's speaking. The visual theme is defined using CSS and SVG images. Sometimes, there are also CSS and SVG animations.
</TextBubble>
<TextBubble position="bottom" alignment="far" theme="yonic" slot="legacy" name="Yonic">
    Text bubbles in the legacy version have the same properties as the ones in the modern version, but the `theme` is handled very differently. Here's how to define a new theme:

    1. **Create a new Astro component in `components/bubbles/themes`**. 
    2. **Have the pops of said component extend the props from the `BubbleBase` component** in `components/bubbles` (in practice, just put `interface Props extends BubbleSpeech {}`).
    3. **Configure the component** with the following controllable properties:
        * `theme`: Internal ID used to locate the assets that will make the bubble.
        * `sizing`: Here you can control the sizes of the outer border in pixels. They each take an array of 2 integers per side (top, left, bottom and right). Only the top side is mandatory. If one side is undefined, it mirrors the opposite side (or the top side if it's the left one, for diagonal mirroring)
        * `speech`: Controls how to place the speech bubble. **Do not set this value directly.** Instead, take it from `Astro.props` and pass it to the `BubbleBase` component.
    4. **Import the new Astro component** in the `TextBubble.astro` component and include it as an element of the `themes` Record.
    5. **Add the assets in the `public/bubbles/<your-theme-id>`** directory. Each asset is comprised of the following GIF images:
        * 9 sliced images that represent the border. The corners go from `top-left` to `bottom-right` and include the sides like `top-center` for vertical and `center-right` for horizontal sides. The 9th image is for the `center`. Edge and center images are meant to be tileable, while corners are not.
        * 4 images for the speech triangle, one for each side of the bubble.
</TextBubble>
</VersionBranch>
<Chara name="yonic" set="summer" sprite="thinking" thoughts="Will someone use this theme? Hard to say..." />

Character sprites work the same for both versions.

<TextBubble position="bottom" alignment="near" theme="yonic" name="Yonic">
    **Characters** have **sets**, each containing their collection of GIF sprite images. Characters are divided by their name, while sets are usually split between costumes or visual appearance. You set which one to use in the props for the `<Chara>` component.

    Additionally, you can set their `position` to the left, center or the right of the line.

    The `thoughts` property allows you to put a string of text that will represent the thoughts of a character, which is shown when the mouse is placed on top of the character image (the cursor will change to a thinking balloon).
</TextBubble>
<Chara name="yonic" set="winter" position="left" sprite="normal" thoughts="Youuuu are readiiiing my miiiiind" />

The following properties control how the text bubbles are displayed on the feeds:

* `name`: The name of the character saying the text.
* `singleLine`: A boolean flag that forces to render the bubble as if it has only one line or not.
    * If true, it renders `<CharaName>Content</CharaName>`, if false, it renders `CharaName: Content`.
    * Normally determined automatically depending on the number of direct descendant elements inside the bubble. **This does not include plain text nodes.**

## Code blocks

They support syntax highlighting, and you can copy code from them in the Modern version. Also, you can set a **filename header** to the code block in two ways:

* **Adding a meta** `filename="filename.extension"` next to the \`\`\` code fences (recommended).
* **Including a comment with two forwardslashes** `// file.comment` as the first line.

**The language for highlighting can be inferred from the filename header**, but it's still recommended to do it so 
If your language isn't supported by Shiki, use `text` or a near equivalent or add it in the Astro config.

Version 1.3.0 introduces a few additional meta and syntax extensions.

* Line marks: With the `mark`, `ins` and `del` (diff) meta properties.
* Syntax extensions: `~~squigglyLines~~` and enhanced comments:
  * **Error style**: `//! Error`, `<!-- ! Error -->`
  * **Warning style**: `//? Warning`, `<!-- ? Warning -->`
  * **Info style**: `//i Info`, `<!-- i Info -->`
  * **Header style**: `//N. Info`, `<!-- N. Info -->` where `N` is a positive integer.
  * **Return style**: `//> Return value`, `<!-- > Return value -->`

In the Legacy version, no numbered line markings will appear, but diff markings will if marked as insertion or deletion lines.

```cpp filename="sample.cpp" mark="6" ins="2-4,7,11-14" del="1"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>

void SayHello( void );

int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    SayHello();

    return ~~"0"~~;  //! "0" is not an int
}


void SayHello( void ) {
    printf( "Hello, world!\n" );
}
```

<!-- 2. HTML Comments -->
<!-- ? Something is the matter -->
<!-- ! This is bad! -->
<!-- i New thing -->
<!-- > Will return this -->
```

## YouTube videos

The Yonic Corner Legacy Version does not support YouTube video playback. If you include one you will see a warning that will guide you to the Modern version.
